# Student Data Analysis Using PowerBi

### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data using Power BI. The dashboard provides actionable insights into students’ academic performance across subjects, and highlights the impact of factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, and test preparation.

By visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs), this project helps educators and decision-makers identify trends, gaps, and opportunities for improvement in student learning outcomes.

### Objectives
1) To evaluate student performance across Math, Reading, and Writing.

2) To analyze the influence of demographics (gender, ethnicity) on academic results.

3) To assess the effect of parental education levels and test preparation courses.

4) To provide data-driven insights for improving teaching strategies and student success.

### Tool Used
PowerBi

### Dataset
1) Name: Students Performance Dataset
2) Source: (e.g., Kaggle: Students Performance in Exams dataset, or your own)
3) Rows: 100 students
4) Columns/Features:
          -Gender (Male/Female)
          -Ethnicity (Group A, B, C, D, E)
          -Parental level of education (High school, Associate’s, Bachelor’s, Master’s, etc.)
          -Test preparation course (Completed/None)
          -Math score
          -Reading score
          -Writing score

### Insights

1) Students who completed test preparation scored higher than those who didn’t.
2) Parental education level positively influences student performance.
3) Gender differences in scores are minimal.
4) Ethnic group variations exist but are less significant compared to preparation and education level.
