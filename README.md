# Student Data Analysis Using PowerBi

### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data using Power BI. The dashboard provides actionable insights into students’ academic performance across subjects, and highlights the impact of factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, and test preparation.

By visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs), this project helps educators and decision-makers identify trends, gaps, and opportunities for improvement in student learning outcomes.

### Objectives
1) To evaluate student performance across Math, Reading, and Writing.

2) To analyze the influence of demographics (gender, ethnicity) on academic results.

3) To assess the effect of parental education levels and test preparation courses.

4) To provide data-driven insights for improving teaching strategies and student success.
